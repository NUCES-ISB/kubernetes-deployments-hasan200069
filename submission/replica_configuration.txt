Replica Configuration Analysis:

1. Current Configuration:
- Default replicas in deployment: 3 (as specified in flask-deployment.yaml)
- Minimum replicas tested: 2 (demonstrated in scaling test)
- Maximum replicas tested: 5 (demonstrated in scaling test)

2. Deployment File Configuration:
- The deployment file (flask-deployment.yaml) specifies replicas: 3
- No HorizontalPodAutoscaler (HPA) is configured, which means:
  * No automatic scaling based on metrics
  * No enforced minimum or maximum replica constraints
  * Manual scaling is unrestricted

3. Scaling Considerations:
- Minimum recommended replicas: 2 (for high availability)
- Maximum recommended replicas: Based on resource availability and load requirements
- Current scaling is manual using: kubectl scale deployment flask-app --replicas=<count>

4. Recommendations for Production:
- Implement HorizontalPodAutoscaler (HPA) for automatic scaling
- Set minimum replicas to 2 for high availability
- Set maximum replicas based on:
  * Cluster resource capacity
  * Expected peak load
  * Cost considerations
  * Performance requirements
